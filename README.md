# HodgeClean
Open computational framework exploring closure relations in algebraic geometry — by David Manning, independent researcher (Galesburg, IL)

The HodgeClean Project

An Open Computational Framework Exploring Closure Relations in Algebraic Geometry

Author: David Manning — Independent Researcher, Galesburg, Illinois
Release type: Public Open Research Artifact (CC BY 4.0)
Date: October 2025

🔍 Overview

HodgeClean is an independently developed computational framework that automates numerical-to-symbolic verification of closure behavior in genus-2 and related systems.
It unifies the earlier OA (Hodge prototype) and the later HodgeProof pipeline, forming a complete reproducible workflow for investigating algebraic-geometric structures connected to the Hodge Conjecture.

The project is released openly to allow mathematicians, data scientists, and AI researchers to reproduce, test, or extend every stage of computation and documentation.

🧩 Core Contributions

1. Reproducibility Infrastructure

SHA-256 manifest and side-car verification for every build.

Environment lockfile and self-verifying sponsor bundles.

Fully automated LaTeX → PDF → ZIP archival chain.



2. Computational Framework

Staged pipeline (Phases LIII – LVIII) running in SageMath 10.7.

Automatic normalization of Ω-operators and λ-closure metrics.

Visualizations and symbolic checkpoints for each phase.



3. Empirical Discovery

Observation of λ-stability: consistent closure metrics across repeated trials and perturbations.

Evidence of functorial behavior of Ω/λ under basic morphisms (e.g., maps on ℙ¹, isogenies on elliptic curves).

Dataset demonstrating reproducible cohomological-style invariance.



4. Transparency and Integrity

Every result is traceable to source notebooks, hashes, and manifests.

Output bundles include raw data, LaTeX sources, PDFs, and checksum files.

⚙️ What This Is — and Is Not

This release does not claim a proof of the Hodge Conjecture.
It provides a constructive, verifiable experimental system that others can analyze, refactor, or extend toward formal results.
The author invites mathematicians and computational scientists to use these artifacts as a starting point for rigorous study.

🧠 Scientific Context

The HodgeClean operator  numerically approximates closure on selected trial spaces, producing repeatable convergence patterns that suggest an underlying cohomological stability.
While not a proof, the reproducibility and invariance patterns may help clarify which algebraic invariants predict closure behavior, serving as data for formal investigations.
